title: "Physics Begins With Noticing"
---

Physics starts with something ordinary: noticing the world. People felt heat, watched water flow, saw the sun rise and set, and observed objects fall long before equations existed. But noticing isn’t enough. Once you want to **communicate** what you notice to someone else, you need structure. Saying “that apple is heavy” or “the day is long” conveys only a vague impression. To make sense to others, impressions need to become **quantities**.

A quantity is simply anything you can point to and say “this much” — long, hot, fast, heavy, bright. The moment you think that way, you’re already thinking like a physicist.

Once you recognize the world in terms of quantities, the next natural step appears:  
**How do we describe these quantities clearly enough that someone else understands them?**


## Quantities Need Units

Quantities only become meaningful when described clearly enough that someone else knows exactly what you mean.

If you tell a fruit vendor, “I want some apples,” that’s not helpful. If you say “five apples,” it works only because **everyone agrees on what one apple means**.

That’s what a **unit** is: a defined “one of something.”

- 3 apples → 3 × (1 apple)  
- 500 dollars → 500 × (1 dollar)  
- 2 hours → 2 × (1 hour)

An important aspect of a unit is that **it is arbitrary — defined by choice**.

A dozen is a great example:

**1 dozen = 12 of something.**

Why 12? No deep reason. It’s arbitrary. But because everyone agrees on 12, the concept works. You can’t insist that your personal dozen is 13.

Physics depends on this same logic. Many units began as arbitrary choices, but what matters is **standardization** — society or the scientific community agreeing on them.


## Standardization of Units

Once humanity agreed that quantities need units, the next challenge was ensuring **everyone uses the same ones**. This is harder than it seems. Different regions once used wildly different measures: one town’s “foot” might be longer than another’s; a “pound” of grain could vary depending on the market.

Science can’t work like that. Predictions, experiments, engineering — none of it survives inconsistency. So over time, societies moved toward **unified systems of measurement**, eventually producing the system used today: the **SI system (Système International d’Unités)**, overseen globally by the **BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures)**.


### Why Standardization Matters

Standard units let people anywhere in the world:

- repeat experiments accurately,  
- build machines with compatible parts,  
- share scientific results precisely,  
- avoid confusion caused by local or historical units.

Without standardization, physics would be chaos.


### The SI Base Units

Modern science defines seven “base units.” Everything else comes from combining these.

| Quantity            | Unit     | Symbol |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Length              | meter    | m      |
| Mass                | kilogram | kg     |
| Time                | second   | s      |
| Electric current    | ampere   | A      |
| Temperature         | kelvin   | K      |
| Amount of substance | mole     | mol    |
| Luminous intensity  | candela  | cd     |

These are chosen not because they are intrinsically special, but because they are:

- precise,  
- reproducible,  
- measurable anywhere,  
- defined in terms of fundamental physical constants.


### Beyond the Base Units

Many familiar units come from combinations of base units:

- **meter/second (m/s)** — speed  
- **watt (J/s)** — power  

Even everyday units like kilometers, liters, or degrees Celsius connect back to the SI system.


### Why This System Works So Well

The SI system succeeds because it:

- reduces everything to a small set of universal building blocks,  
- lets scientists and engineers collaborate across cultures and languages,  
- allows precise definitions tied to unchanging constants.

It’s the backbone of modern physics — the shared language that makes the whole subject possible.


## The Bigger Picture

Understanding quantities, units, and standardization is more than vocabulary. It’s the foundation for everything in physics. Once you can describe the world clearly, you can start explaining it, predicting it, and modeling it — which is the heart of the subject.

Physics begins with noticing.  
But it becomes powerful when noticing becomes measurable.

You’re not learning to solve problems.
You’re learning to speak a new language — the language of the universe.
