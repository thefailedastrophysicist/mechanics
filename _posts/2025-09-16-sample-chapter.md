title: "What We’re Really Doing When We “Do Physics”"
---

Strip away the equations, diagrams, and intimidating symbols, and physics begins with something extremely ordinary: noticing the world. People noticed long before science existed. They saw the sun rise and set, felt heat and cold, watched water flow, threw stones and saw them fall. None of this required math. It just required paying attention.

That’s why the earliest name for physics makes perfect sense: the philosophy of nature. It wasn’t about formulas; it was about trying to understand the world with reason instead of superstition. Even today, the best physicists aren’t the ones who solve equations fastest — they’re the ones who actually observe what’s happening.

But observation alone isn’t enough. Physics became powerful only when people realized that to understand something, you must be able to describe it — not in a story, but in a way that someone else can grasp clearly, even if they aren’t there with you.

That’s where quantities enter the picture.

A quantity is simply anything you can point to and say, “this much.”
“This is long.”
“This is heavy.”
“This took a while.”

Whenever you think in those terms, you’re already thinking in the language of quantities — even if you don’t notice it.

But a quantity only becomes useful when you can express it so clearly that another person knows exactly what you mean.

If you tell a fruit seller, “I want some apples,” that isn’t helpful.
“How many?” they’ll ask.

“Five” is better — but even then, “one apple” must mean the same thing to both of you. Luckily, apples are physical objects, so that’s easy.

But what about warmth? Distance? Duration?
These aren’t things you can hold. They’re impressions — until you attach numbers and units to them.

This was one of the great breakthroughs in the history of physics:

To understand something, you need to measure it.
To measure it, you need to define a unit.

A unit is just a way of saying “one of something.”
One apple. One minute. One meter. One cup. One degree.

Ancient cultures measured many things — the Babylonians excelled at angles and time — but they did not yet have the modern idea of physical quantities like mass, force, or temperature. They counted and tracked, but they didn’t treat these ideas as measurable entities that could be expressed numerically in a unified way.

Once you define what “one” means, you can talk about “three,” “ten,” “half,” or “double.” And once two people agree on the unit, they can communicate across rooms, continents, or centuries.

This is why physics needs units — not to make life difficult, but because without them, the world becomes impossible to describe.

Now let’s talk about numbers, because this is where many beginners suddenly feel math becoming foreign. When you see “10 apples,” your brain automatically separates it into:

10 → number
apples → unit

You’ve done this since childhood without thinking. This simple ability — separating the number from the “thing” it counts — is the silent foundation of all physics.

Everything you’ll see later is just more elaborate versions of:

a number × a unit

“Two minutes” is simply:

2 × (one minute)

Physics just extends this idea to quantities that aren’t as immediately tangible — things like speed, force, brightness, or pressure. They feel abstract only because we don’t hold them in our hands.

This is where imagination becomes your greatest tool. If you can visualize a quantity — even roughly — you will understand it. You won’t need to memorize formulas. Your mind will build little “movies” of what’s happening. That’s what physicists do: they imagine a situation, then use quantities to record that imagination clearly.

There’s one more mathematical attitude worth embracing:
when we calculate, we operate on the units just as much as on the numbers.

Students often treat units as decorative stickers slapped on at the end, but they’re not. Units follow rules. They multiply, divide, and cancel exactly the way numbers do. This isn’t a “physics rule” — it’s simply logical consistency.

And once you start thinking this way, something beautiful happens:
the math stops being something separate.
It becomes a natural extension of your reasoning.

Quantities become Lego blocks.
Units become clues.
Equations become sentences describing ideas you already understand.

One final clarification: when I say that mathematics becomes part of your thinking, I don’t mean that physics “is just math.” Math is a language. Physics uses it because the universe behaves in ways that can be described clearly with that language. The imagination comes first; the math lets you freeze that imagination so someone else can see it.

This, honestly, is the real starting point of physics. People rush past it because it looks simple. But if you truly absorb this — that physics is about quantities, units, imagination, and clarity — the rest becomes far easier.

Everything that follows is just a more detailed story built on this foundation.

You’re not learning to solve problems.
You’re learning to speak a new language — the language of the universe.
